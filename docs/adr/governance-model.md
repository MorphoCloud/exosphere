# ADR 5: Governance model

## Status

WIP

## Context

Exosphere is a community-driven open source project.

We have an [interim governance model](https://exosphere.app/docs/governance/). From [!750 Documenting interim governance for Exosphere](https://gitlab.com/exosphere/exosphere/-/merge_requests/750):

> #815 tracks the effort to investigate potential governance models for Exosphere. In that issue, @julianpistorius linked to the CNCF [project template](https://github.com/cncf/project-template), specifically the [simple maintainer governance](https://github.com/cncf/project-template/blob/main/GOVERNANCE-maintainer.md).
>
> We both agreed that the template was somewhat close to how the Exosphere project has already been governed since its inception, and short enough to understand and modify with ease. So, we removed the parts that didn't already apply, and tweaked the parts which do.
>
> This doesn't solve #815 or #819 -- it just serves to capture approximately what we already have, as a starting point to evolve it.

In [POSE 3.2.1: Investigate governance models #815](https://gitlab.com/exosphere/exosphere/-/issues/815#note_1404718326) we have a fairly detailed investigation of four governance models. Specifically we evaluated how/if each model addresses governance acceptance criteria required by the [Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) Best Practices](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/en/criteria.ce) program, as well as the [Open Source Collective](https://docs.oscollective.org/getting-started/acceptance-criteria).

### What would success / a fix look like?

From our POSE Phase I proposal, a governance model that provides well-defined mechanisms for stakeholders to:

1. Act in neutral forums
2. Encourage participation
3. Guide discussions
4. Build consensus
5. Resolve conflicts

That results in us achieving [our sustainability goals](https://exosphere.app/docs/sustainability-goals/):

> - Is responsive to changing needs of its community
> - Has maintainers who set strategic direction to meet community needs, and ensure the long-term health of the project
> - Has project members regularly engaged and available to respond to community requests
> - Recruits new project members to compensate for attrition
> - Grows existing project members toward becoming maintainers
> - Maintains a secure, trustworthy open source product

## Choices

### 1. Status quo

We continue with our [interim governance model](https://exosphere.app/docs/governance/), evolving over time in response to community needs.

- Good: No change to the way we currently operate
- Bad: Not sure that the current model is sustainable in the long term
- Bad: Current model will likely prevent some corporations from adopting, promoting, and contributing to Exosphere 

### 2. Apache Software Foundation (ASF) model

For Exosphere this would mean:

- Studying [the incubator cookbook](https://incubator.apache.org/cookbook/) in detail to decide if the ASF is a good fit, then going through the steps to join the [ASF Incubator](https://incubator.apache.org/).
- Execute a formal [Software Grant Agreement (SGA)](https://www.apache.org/licenses/contributor-agreements.html#grants) to transfer the Exosphere codebase to the ASF
- Adopting the [Apache License 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)
  - We will have to contact all past & present contributors to get their explicit permission to relicense their contributions. If we can't get permission from everyone, we'll have to remove their contributions from the codebase.
- Adopting the [Apache Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](https://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas)
- Adopting the [Apache Way](https://www.apache.org/theapacheway/), specifically:
    - Set up a project management committee (PMC) to oversee the project, which would involve board meetings, reporting, etc.
    - All technical decisions and the great majority of the work should take place on public mailing lists. Decisions SHALL NOT be made in other media, like IRC, Slack channels, face to face at conferences, nor presumably on GitLab issues or MRs.
- Move to an ASF-blessed code platform (GitHub or Apache's GitBox) and use Apache's CI/CD infrastructure
- ...and more

Pros & Cons:

- Good: The ASF is a well-established, well-respected, and well-funded organization with a proven track record of successfully incubating and managing open source projects
- Good: More appealing for corporations to adopt, promote, and contribute to Exosphere
- Bad: The ASF is a large, bureaucratic organization with a lot of overhead
- Bad: We would have to relicense all past contributions to the codebase
- Bad: We would have to move to a new code platform and CI/CD infrastructure

### 3. Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) model

For Exosphere this would mean:

- Follow the [project proposal process](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/process/project_proposals.md)
- Adopt [IP policy](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/main/charter.md#11-ip-policy), including:
  - Decide if we want to adopt a CLA
  - Ensure that all new code contributions are accompanied by a DCO (Developer Certificate of Origin sign-off) (https://developercertificate.org) and made under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (Note: Not clear if we would need to relicense existing contributions)
  - Transfer ownership of trademark and logo assets to the Linux Foundation
- Meet the [incubating stage criteria](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/process/graduation_criteria.md#incubating-stage), including:
  - Document that it is being used successfully in production by at least three independent direct adopters which, in the TOCâ€™s judgement, are of adequate quality and scope. For the definition of an adopter, see https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/FAQ.md#what-is-the-definition-of-an-adopter.
  - Have a healthy number of committers. A committer is defined as someone with the commit bit; i.e., someone who can accept contributions to some or all of the project.
  - Demonstrate a substantial ongoing flow of commits and merged contributions.
  - Since these metrics can vary significantly depending on the type, scope and size of a project, the TOC has final judgement over the level of activity that is adequate to meet these criteria
  - A clear versioning scheme.
  - Clearly documented security processes explaining how to report security issues to the project, and describing how the project provides updated releases or patches to resolve security vulnerabilities
- Meet the [graduation criteria](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/process/graduation-proposal-template.md#graduation-state-criteria), including:
  - Have committers from at least two organizations
  - Achieve and maintain a [Core Infrastructure Initiative Best Practices Badge](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/)
  - Have completed an independent and third party security audit with results published of similar scope and quality as [this example](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy#security-audit) which includes all critical vulnerabilities and all critical vulnerabilities need to be addressed before graduation.
  - Explicitly define a project governance and committer process. The committer process should cover the full committer lifecycle including onboarding and offboarding or emeritus criteria. This preferably is laid out in a GOVERNANCE.md file and references an OWNERS.md file showing the current and emeritus committers.
  - Explicitly define the criteria, process and offboarding or emeritus conditions for project maintainers; or those who may interact with the CNCF on behalf of the project. The list of maintainers should be preferably be stored in a MAINTAINERS.md file and audited at a minimum of an annual cadence.

Pros & Cons:

- Good: The CNCF is a well-established, well-respected, and well-funded organization with a proven track record of successfully incubating and managing open source projects
- Good: The CNCF governance process is more modern, and not as heavy as the ASF's
- Good: We can continue to use GitLab and our existing CI/CD infrastructure
- Good: More appealing for corporations to adopt, promote, and contribute to Exosphere
- Bad: Unclear if Exosphere "fits" in the Cloud Native landscape

### 4. Open Infrastructure Foundation model

Assuming we fit best as a project under the wider Open Infrastructure umbrella, and not OpenStack specifically, for Exosphere this would mean:

- Work with the OpenInfra Foundation on a governance process, because according to the [bylaws](https://openinfra.dev/legal/bylaws):
    > The governance of the OpenStack Project is set forth in the Bylaws, but each Open Infrastructure Project is governed separately by procedures approved by the Board of Directors. The application of the other terms of the Bylaws which apply to the OpenStack Project will not apply to the Open Infrastructure Projects unless determined by Board of Directors.
- Adopt the [OpenInfra Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](https://openinfra.dev/cla/) and Apache 2.0 License
    > Open Infrastructure Foundation projects use the Apache License, Version 2.0 with a Contributor License Agreement (CLA), in a way comparable to Apache Foundation projects
  - Rationale from ['source' chapter of the Four Opens](https://opendev.org/openinfra/four-opens/src/branch/master/doc/source/opensource.rst):
    > (Apache Licence V2.0) includes a number of provisions that also protect end-users by granting copyright and patent licenses to all, while limiting liability to the original copyright holder. This patent protection is one of the distinguishing features in comparison to other open source licenses, like the MIT License.
  - Though we _might_ be able to avoid relicensing to Apache 2.0. See [Bylaws Article VII. Intellectual Property Policy, 7.1 (c)](https://openinfra.dev/legal/bylaws):
    > The Board of Directors may approve a license for an Open Infrastructure Project other than Apache License 2.0, ...
- Migrate to [OpenDev](https://opendev.org/) for code hosting, code review, and CI/CD (Gitea, Gerrit, and Zuul respectively), even though in theory this is negotiable
- Use mailing lists and IRC as main means of communication and decision making

Pros & Cons:

- Good: The OpenInfra Foundation is a well-established, well-respected, and well-funded organization with a proven track record of successfully managing open source projects
- Good: Exosphere could be a good fit, because it both builds on, and enhances the appeal of OpenStack
- Good: More appealing for corporations to adopt, promote, and contribute to Exosphere
- Bad: Not many examples of successfully incubating non-OpenStack projects
- Bad: We would probably have to move to a new code platform and CI/CD infrastructure

### 5. C4 (Collective Code Construction Contract) model

For Exosphere this would mean mostly business as usual, with some notable exceptions below:

- Use a share-alike license such as the MPLv2, or a GPLv3 variant thereof (GPL, LGPL, AGPL), unless we can modify C4 to be compatible with the BSD 3-Clause license (see below)
  - There is no copyright assignment or CLA, and all patches are owned by their authors, and shall use the same license as the project
  - Unknown: Is this is compatible with the BSD 3-Clause license?
- A patch (merge request) SHOULD be a minimal and accurate answer to exactly one identified and agreed problem
- The release history of the project SHALL be a list of meaningful issues logged and solved
- Standardize formatting of commit messages
- Maintainers SHALL NOT make value judgments on correct patches
- Maintainers SHALL merge correct patches from other Contributors rapidly
- Any Contributor who has value judgments on a patch SHOULD express these via their own patches
- Maintainers SHOULD close user issues that are left open without action for an uncomfortable period of time

Pros & Cons:

- Good: Very simple and lightweight governance process (one short page)
- Good: Goals are closely aligned with our requirements
- Good: Workflow is very close to what we are used to
- Good and Bad: No organization to join, this is self-governance. So no benefits of being part of a larger organization, but also none of the downsides.
- Unknown: Not sure if this is compatible with the BSD 3-Clause license
- Unknown: Because we are used to tighter control over the codebase, the policy of no value judgments and rapid merging of correct patches might require some adjustment and cause conflict in the short term. It could be beneficial in the long term if it pays off in more contributions and more contributors, as long as we can ensure that the quality of the codebase remains high.
- Bad: Less appealing for corporations to adopt, promote, and contribute to Exosphere
